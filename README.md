# Updates
Version 1.0.0 (The first stable version) is open! This is by far a primitive version of the site, but all the games that aren't labeled as unavailible should all be working perfectly. If you come across a problem fill out the [Feedback Form](https://forms.gle/uicJnrD2XpBhEM9Y8)

# ZIP Instructions For Chromebook
For many people, the site is blocked. To solve this issue, simply download the zip and open the index.html file.

Notice: The ZIP file will not automatically update. If there is an update you wish to have, you must delete the old ZIP and redownload the current one.

## Steps

### 1. Download the ZIP from GitHub
Scroll to the top of the repository webpage and find the green code button.

Click this and then click "Download ZIP"
### 2. Navigating the files
Once the file has downloaded, go to the files app and there should be a zip file named "Lunar-arch.github.io-main"

Double click this and then double click the folder inside. 

There should be a bunch of other folders and files. 

If you want to navigate to the homepage, simply double click the file named "index.html"

# Site vs. ZIP
[The site](Lunar-arch.github.io) is the most accesible way to use this and it offers more games that work, but it can be seen by GoGuardian. Also, at the moment, the ZIP is blocked since GoGuardian is restricting all sites that have files having to do with 1v1.lol. If you choose to download the zip, and open index.html, then, GoGuardian will show the last active tab. While games marked with " * " are not usually accesible through the ZIP file, currently all the games that are not marked as unavailible will all work using the ZIP.
