# Site vs. ZIP
the site is the most accesible way to use this and it offers more games that work, but it can be seen by GoGuardian. If you choose to download the zip, and open index.html, then, GoGuardian will show the last active tab, but all games are not acessible. Games marked with " * " are not accesible through the ZIP file
